# (Ford Go Bike Dataset Exploration)
## by (Umar Ibrahim)


## Ford Go Bike

> Ford go bike dataset is data set that includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Summary of Findings

In summary, the findings shows the richness of the data when i combined my previous knowledge of the last project on data wrangling with this on visualization. combining data warngling (even though some are not commented or put on a markdown) and exploration using visualization made the work more rich. I used the question, visualization and observation format for each exploration. Conversion of some of the variables like latitiude and longitude to obtain distance and duration_sec to obtain minutes and importantly to days of the week(mon,tue,wed... sunday) assisted in my exploration. Having an upper and lower Limit on member birth year due to much data gave a better visualizationa and understanding of the data. Tools like xlimit for the x-axis on some variabes made our data visualization clearer as we truncated outliers. The list below list our findings:
Thursdays have more rides while weekends have less rides.
subscribers take on far more rides than customers
more males take on rides than females with a large difference
Most users to large extent did not share their bikes as only just a few did. no customer shared his/her ride.
trip distance is usually between 5 to 7 minutes
San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St) station had more rides than any station and customers had more rides than subscribers.
